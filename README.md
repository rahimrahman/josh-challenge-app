# JOSH.ai Code Challenge Mobile App

This app was developed to compliment a code challenge task by Josh.ai.  A simple library [`simple-hue-library`](https://github.com/rahimrahman/simple-hue-library) was created as part of the code challenge and used in this project to showcase that the app can be re-used in React and Node.js app.  The actual code challenge can be found here:

This app was also developed using Exponent.  This enabled the app to be demonstrated without actually building an .ipa or .apk.

To run this app, simply download Exponent iOS or Android app from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?ct=www&mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www).  Then, use the QR scanner on the app and scan the QR code below:
